        <h3>Seismic activity and the Drifiting Indian Plate</h3>
        <p>About 140 million years ago, Gondwana (The Super Continent) broke into Antarctic, African, Australian and the Indian Plate. The Indian Plate drifting north collided with Eurasian plate,giving rise to the Himalayas.</p>

        <p>The cause of major earthquakes in these regions is due to the <em>active movement</em> of Indian Plate northwards by 5cm per year. These collisions are cause of seismic activities.</p>
